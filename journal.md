# Introduction
The lazy brown fox jumped over the quick dog (Haywood et al 1999). A further sentence about something that is a thing. Some more writing about said thing. Maybe a little bit more.
Starting to get a bit bored now, but will power through nevertheless. Andisestablishmentarianism is a long word.
Also, using an aerosol mass spec (Allen et al 2000.)

# Simulations
John has made some simulations of particle formation using his box model.
It reproduces the growth in size distributions observed and suggests that coagulation is the dominant method of growth.
